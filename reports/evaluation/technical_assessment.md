## Overview
Technical evaluation of the **final XGBoost model** focusing on efficiency, resource usage, and reproducibility.

| Metric | Value |
|:--------|------:|
| Training Runtime (approx.) | 6.3 s |
| Inference Time (10 samples) | 1.357 ms |
| CPU Utilization | 12.1% |
| Memory Usage | 47.12 MB |
| Model Size | 0.12 MB |
| Total Runtime | 1.01 s |

## Reproducibility & MLOps Readiness
- **Random Seed:** Fixed (`random_state = 42`)
- **Serialization:** Joblib (`.pkl` format)
- **Pipeline Determinism:** Reproducible preprocessing & model training
- **Version Control:** Models and reports tracked via Git
- **CI/CD Compatibility:** Model artifacts can be tested and deployed through GitHub Actions
- **Environment:** Requirements listed in `requirements.txt`

## Environment Details
| Component | Version |
|------------|----------|
| Python | 3.13.5 |
| pandas | 2.3.3 |
| scikit-learn | 1.7.2 |
| xgboost | XGBClassifier |
| joblib | 1.5.2 |

---

## Notes
- The model is lightweight and efficient (<10 MB) → suitable for FastAPI inference.  
- Inference latency (<5 ms per sample) meets real-time deployment standards.  
- The entire pipeline is reproducible and ready for integration into CI/CD and AWS deployment workflows.
